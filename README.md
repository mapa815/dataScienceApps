1) Simple Data Science apps using python

# How to run them

First thing that you need is "STREAMLIT" (a pretty useful library that makes it easy to run and develop simple apps)
Next, go to the folder where the files are stored, and run the following command
streamlit run 'name of the file'.py

Ex. 
If the python file is called stock_app, then the command will be:
stramlit run stock_app.py
